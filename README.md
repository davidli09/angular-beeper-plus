Angular Drum Machine
--------------------

A basic drum machine built with [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js "AngularJS"), HTML5 Audio (via [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js "howler.js")), and a simple [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra "Sinatra") wrapper.

I built this Drum Machine to experiment with AngularJS and plan to add features (and a demo site) as time permits.
